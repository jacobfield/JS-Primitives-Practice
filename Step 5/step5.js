// Step 5: Exploring Functional Programming with Array Methods
// Objective: Understand functional programming concepts and their application in JavaScript.
// Topics to cover:
// Functional programming principles: immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions.
// Transforming data with array methods: using map, filter, reduce in functional programming style.
// Advantages of functional programming: code readability, maintainability, testability.
// Criteria for Mastery:
// Explain the concept of immutability and its importance in functional programming.
// How do higher-order functions differ from regular functions?
// Provide an example of using map to transform an array of objects.
